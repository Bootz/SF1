The THANKS file:

All distributions should contain a `THANKS' file containing a two column list
of the contributors, one per line, alphabetically sorted. The left column gives
the contributor's name, while the right column gives the last known good email
address for this contributor. This list should be introduced with a wording
similar to this one:

 Oregon Core THANKS file

 Oregon Core is a derivation/rewrite of Trinity Core, which was originally written
 by the MaNGOS team. Many people further helped Oregon Core
 by submitting bug reports, code patches, and suggestions. Thanks to the
 community!

 Thanks to the ImpConfig developer (dythzer) for the custom configuration patch.

 Thanks to the ScriptDev2 team (http://www.scriptdev2.com) for scripts.

The easiest policy with this file is to thank everyone who contributes to the
project, without judging the value of the contribution.

Unlike `AUTHORS', the `THANKS' file is not maintained for legal reasons. It is
maintained to thank all the contributors that helped you out in your project.
The `AUTHORS' file can not be used for this purpose because certain
contributions, like bug reports or ideas and suggestions do not require legal
paper exchanges.

You can also decide to send some kind of special greeting when you initially
add a name to your `THANKS' file. The mere presense of a name in `THANKS' is
then a flag to you that the initial greeting has been sent.
